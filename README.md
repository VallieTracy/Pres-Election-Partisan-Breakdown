# Election Breakdown     
#### <i>Looking at the 2016 Presidential Election voting breakdown, based on party-votes and total ballots casts</i>               
Given how politically fraught the U.S. currently feels, we wanted to explore just how partisan the country actually is.  To answer that question, we looked at what the actual vote tallies were, broken down by Republican and Democrat.  It can feel like the country is intensely either-or.  Either you're a Democrat.  Or you're a Republican.  But we hypothesized that the country is overwhelmingly "purple."  With this project, we strove to show that the people of the U.S. are more similar than not by the diversity of the vote tallies.
